BST 222 Final Project: Survival Analysis


The final project for Biostatistics 222: Survival Analysis (F25), at UC Davis. This course is required for Ph.D. biostatistics students, and the 
course content is tested on the Ph.D. preliminary exam.

The authors of this project are Lucas Webster (first year Biostat Ph.D. student), Berna Paez (), Lei Huang (), and Yifan Yang (). We used the 
ACTG320 dataset from the GLDreg package to analyze time-to-AIDS diagnosis data on HIV-1 infected patients taking Indinavir for treatment against
those who took the standard treatments at the time.

The slides in this repository were presented to the course on 12//25.
